# Importer for getting Google Keep Notes into a Notion Database

Converts a set of markdown files representing a Google Keep Takeout into a Notion database.

To get the markdown files you can use the obsidian converter.
(sorry that's just route I ended up taking!)

See config_example.yaml for notes on how to use.

If anybody has an interest in this then I'll package it up a little better and write some docs.

The results make for a much more structured experience that Google Keep with no loss of function:
- checkboxes
- links
- embedded photos and videos with captions
- all tags and colours preserved
